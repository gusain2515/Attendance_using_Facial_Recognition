# Real-Time Face Recognition Attendance System
This project implements a real-time face recognition-based attendance system using the face_recognition library and OpenCV. The system recognizes faces from a webcam feed, matches them against pre-stored images of employees, and marks their attendance in a CSV file.
# Features
Face Recognition: Detects and recognizes faces in real-time from a webcam.
Attendance Marking: Logs attendance with the employee's name and timestamp.
CSV Logging: Maintains an attendance record in Attendance.csv.
Scalable: Easily add new employee images to the system for recognition.
